# Cominfo---An-Mobile-App-For-PUFA-COMPUTING

 This application designed to facilitate Computing
 students in acquiring essential information about key entities within President University.
 These include the President University Faculty Association (PUFA) of Computing,
 President University Major Association (PUMA) of Informatics, President University
 Major Association (PUMA) of Information Systems, and President University Major
 Association (PUMA) of Visual Communication Design. ComInfo serves as a
 comprehensive platform offering an array of information categories, encompassing
 detailed descriptions of the organizations, profiles of their respective members,
 information on faculty members associated with the study programs, details about
 organized events by each association, and direct contact information for communication
 purposes as a part of final project for Wireless And Mobile Programming Course

 buttons, each to know the information. The first button leads to a comprehensive overview of
 President University Faculty Association (PUFA) of Computing, accompanied by dedicated
 "Member" and "Lecture" buttons that offer direct access to the organization's member showcase
 and educational content. Similarly, the second, third, and fourth buttons guide users through brief
 descriptions of President University Major Association (PUMA) of Informatics, President
 University Major Association (PUMA) of Information Systems, and President University Major

 by convenient "Member" and "Lecture" button.
 Proceeding to the event feature below, it provides past, ongoing, and upcoming events,
 detailed descriptions alongside the information such as dates, times, and venues. It is important
 to note that the privilege of adding events is exclusively vested in administrators, ensuring a
 controlled and accurate dissemination of event details for the benefit of computing students. This
 approach guarantees that the computing community remains well-informed about the entirety of
 events, both historical and forthcoming, contributing to a informed engagement with the
 academic calendar

 Concluding our feature lineup, the login and register functionality is specifically designed
 for administrators. This essential feature grants administrators access to the application,
 empowering them to create, update, and delete data associated with lectures, members, and
 events. Through this secure login system, administrators can efficiently manage by create, read,
 update and delete information, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of data related to lectures,
 members, and the event feature. The inclusion of these capabilities enhances the overall
 administrative control, facilitating organization of important information within the application
